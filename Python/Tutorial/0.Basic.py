Q1. What is programming language? Why do we need this? Types of programming language?

ANS: *A programming language is a formal set of instructions and rules used to communicate with computers and tell them what tasks to perform. 
Programming languages serve as a bridge between human instructions and machine code, which is the binary code that computers understand directly. They enable us to create software, applications, websites, and systems by writing code that specifies the desired functionality.

*Programming languages allow developers to design solutions to real-world problems by creating software, mobile apps, and websites. From data analysis to artificial intelligence, programming languages are essential for advancing technology.

* Mainly (Three Types) 
- High-level languages (High-level languages are closer to human languages and abstract away most of the machine-level details. eg.. Python , Java)
- Low-level languages (Low-level languages are closer to machine code and provide more control over hardware. eg.. Assembly )
- Scripting languages(good for automating repetitive tasks. eg.. Bash, js)

Q2. Compiler vs. Interpreter

ANS:
Compiler	                        Interpreter
Translates entire code at once	    Translates and executes line-by-line

Faster (code is precompiled)	    Slower (code translated at runtime)

OutputProduces an executable file	Directly executes code without a file

Reports errors after entire         Reports errors line-by-line during execution
code is compiled	                                                            

eg.. C, C++, Rust	                Python, Ruby, JavaScript

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. What is Python?

ANS: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4. Write an Hello World Program in Python!

ANS: print("Hello World !")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. What do you mean by Mutable and immutable?

ANS: * Mutable objects are those whose values or contents can be changed after they are created. If you modify a mutable object, you don't create a new object; you modify the original one in place.
Examples of Mutable Types:
Lists
Dictionaries
Sets
bytearray

* Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that would modify an immutable object instead creates a new object with the modified value, leaving the original object unchanged.

Examples of Immutable Types:
Strings
Tuples
Integers
Floats
Booleans
frozenset
bytes

**NOTE: will get to know about this in detail in datatype section.
