"""
A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is True.
Syntax:
while condition:
    # code to execute
    #increment or decrement
Condition: This is an expression that is evaluated. If it's True, the loop will run. Once the condition becomes False, the loop stops.
Example:
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
Explanation: This will print numbers from 1 to 5. The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
